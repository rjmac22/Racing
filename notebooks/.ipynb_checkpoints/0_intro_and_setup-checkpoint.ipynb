    "# 🐎 Horse Racing Analytics – Notebook 1: Getting Started with Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first notebook in this series, where we adapt the lessons from *Football Analytics with Python & R* by Eric Eager to the world of **horse racing**. Instead of analyzing American football plays, we’ll explore a cleaned and structured database containing over 30 years of UK and Irish horse racing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Goals of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect to the local `raceform.db` SQLite database.\n",
    "- Load and inspect a sample of the cleaned race data (`data_clean` table).\n",
    "- Understand the structure and meaning of key columns (e.g., race type, distance, going, result).\n",
    "- Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
    "- Create visualisations to explore patterns and distributions in the dataset.\n",
    "- Lay the foundation for future notebooks focused on prediction and modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook mirrors Chapter 1 of the book, but uses horse racing data instead of football. The principles are the same: get to know your data, spot issues, and build intuition before modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools Used:**\n",
    "- Python 3\n",
    "- pandas for data manipulation\n",
    "- SQLite for local data access\n",
    "- matplotlib / seaborn for plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**  \n",
    "The `raceform.db` SQLite database contains over 1 million rows of race data from 1990 onwards. We'll work with a sample in this notebook for performance reasons.\n",

    "## 🔍 Key Observations So Far\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading a sample of 100,000 rows from the `data_clean` table, we now have a good overview of the dataset's structure and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗂️ Dataset Summary\n",
    "- **Rows loaded:** 100,000\n",
    "- **Columns:** 40\n",
    "- **Unique races:** 11,297\n",
    "- **Unique horses:** 32,207\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Column Types\n",
    "- **Race-level information:** `date`, `course`, `type`, `class`, `going`, `dist`, `ran`\n",
    "- **Horse-level information:** `horse`, `age`, `sex`, `draw`, `wgt`, `sp`, `pos`, `or`, `rpr`, `dnf`\n",
    "- **Target-like variables:** `pos` (finishing position), `dnf` (did not finish), `sp` (starting price)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Missing Data Highlights\n",
    "- `draw` — missing in ~29% of rows\n",
    "- `or` (Official Rating) — missing in ~45% of rows\n",
    "- `ts` (TopSpeed Rating) — missing in ~32% of rows\n",
    "- `prize` — missing in more than half of rows\n",
    "- `currency` — completely empty (likely not yet parsed or needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Understanding Missing Values \n",
    "\n",
    "We identified missing values in several key performance-related columns. Rather than treating them as errors, it's important to understand why they’re missing and when it makes sense to include them in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `draw` – Stall Number\n",
    "- Only relevant for **flat races** where horses start in stalls.\n",
    "- Missing in **jumps races** like hurdles or chases.\n",
    "- ✅ Use `draw` only when `type == 'Flat'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `or` – Official Rating\n",
    "- A handicap mark assigned by the BHA.\n",
    "- Missing when:\n",
    "  - A horse is **unrated** (e.g., new/maiden races)\n",
    "  - The race type doesn't use ratings.\n",
    "- ✅ Use `or` for handicap analysis or experienced horses.\n",
    "- ✅ Consider flagging `has_or = True/False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `ts` – TopSpeed Rating\n",
    "- A Racing Post speed-based performance score.\n",
    "- Missing when:\n",
    "  - The horse did not finish or was too far behind.\n",
    "  - The race wasn’t rated (e.g., older or lower-class races).\n",
    "- ✅ Use `ts` for speed analysis, possibly alongside `rpr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💰 Understanding Missing Prize Data\n",
    "\n",
    "While inspecting the dataset, we noticed that around **45%** of the horses had a non-null value in the `prize` column, and **100%** were missing from the `currency` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than treating this as bad or corrupt data, it's important to understand **why** it's missing — and what that tells us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why Is `prize` Missing for Some Horses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every horse in a race wins prize money. Typically:\n",
    "- Only the **winner** and a few **placed runners** receive any payout.\n",
    "- In small fields, prizes might go to the top 2 or 3 finishers.\n",
    "- In larger or high-value races, up to 6th place (or more) might get paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when `prize` is missing, it usually means the horse finished **outside the money** — i.e., did not earn a placing that awards cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✅ **Conclusion:** Missing `prize` values are not an error — they’re an expected outcome for most runners.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💱 What About `currency`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `currency` column is completely empty in our sample. Based on the documentation, it was meant to be parsed from the `prize_raw` string (e.g., \"£3,500\" → currency = \"£\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version of the database, that parsing either hasn't happened or was deprecated in favour of normalising all prize values to a standard currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✅ **Conclusion:** `currency` can be ignored for now unless we need to reverse-engineer raw prize strings in future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Before cleaning or engineering features, always ask:\n",
    "- Why is this data missing?\n",
    "- Is it truly incomplete, or just *not applicable*?\n",
    "- Does the absence itself carry useful meaning?\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of context-aware thinking avoids wasting time fixing \"problems\" that aren't really problems — and helps us extract richer insight from the data.\n",
    "\n"

    "## 🐎 Different Forms of Horse Racing = Different Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in football, where passing plays differ from running plays, horse racing includes multiple **forms of racing** that operate under different rules and dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset includes a `type` column that distinguishes between race types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Flat`: No jumps, often influenced by draw and speed\n",
    "- `Hurdle`: Smaller jumps, more attrition\n",
    "- `Chase`: Larger jumps, higher DNF rates\n",
    "- `NH Flat` or `Bumper`: Pre-jump schooling races\n",
    "- `Hunter`: Steeplechases for amateur riders\n",
    "\n",
    "We must avoid treating all races the same. Each form has unique dynamics, risks, and performance patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🧠 So from this point onward, we’ll analyse races by type — starting with **Flat racing**, where stalls, draw, and pace play a central role."
